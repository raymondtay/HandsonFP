# HandsonFP

This tutorial assumes that you have some prior experience programming in Scala.
This series of exercises might be a little overwhelming for the absolute
beginner but once you have gained some proficiency in Scala, i am positive you
would be able to follow.

## Getting Started

You should be comfortable with the Linux/Unix/WinOS/macOS environment
configuring it. I do not have instructions on how to leverage IDEs, so please
use Google or Stackoverflow for your individual purposes.

To start from the ground up, you basically need the following:
- You would need a Oracle JDK version `1.8` to be installed on your environment.
- You would need to install the Scala build tool aka `sbt` from
  [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html). (**Note:** There're  
  installation instructions on each operating system like macOS, Linux/Unix,
  Win OS.)
- Your favourite editor (i use [neovim](https://neovim.io/)) or IDE.
- You should not have trouble cloning this repository.

### A little about me

I really enjoy Scala, Haskell and have developed some skills in functional
programming. I hope to share with you my passion in functional programming and
hope that you have learnt something from this.

Onward and forward !

## Format of the tutorial

This tutorial is drawn from a few sources of inspiration but since they are
open sourced, there's no danger of forgery here but i hope the original authors
do not fault me if i added some embellishment here and there.

Note: All answers to the exercises will be revealed 1 class after each training.
